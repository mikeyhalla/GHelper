# GHelper

Troubleshooting steps  
====================  
- Make sure your game shortcuts run in directory is correct
- Make sure that you have a Games folder in either all users or user start menu
- Make sure Game shortcuts are named correctly

  
How to install: 
1. Unzip to a location that you want it
2. If you have Acer Aspire V3-571 Family, unzip the Fan Controller Driver Zip Folder and follow instructions. Once done, make sure that FanControl.exe is in the same folder as GHelper.exe.
3. If you want to use ShadowEx with GHelper, unzip ShadowEx.zip into the same folder as GHelper.exe and adjust settings accordingly.
4. If you want to have GHelper run at startup and don't want to see an annoying window popup, unzip ArgsHidden.zip into the same folder as GHelper.exe and setup accordingly. You only need to do this if you want to run GHelper as Administrator.
5. Run GHelper and then open settings and setup as you like.

Do NOT attempt to use the FanControl.exe unless you have the above mentioned laptop.
